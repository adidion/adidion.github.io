# The Mandalorian
Mandalorians are fictional people associated with the planet Mandalore in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas.
First conceptualized for The Empire Strikes Back as a group of white-armored "supercommandos", the idea developed into a single
bounty hunter character known as Boba Fett.

Although the term "Mandalorian" is never used in the films, the popularity of Boba Fett inspired an extensive number of works about
Mandalorians in the greater Star Wars franchise.
Here "The Mandalorian" refers to the new TV series "Star Wars: The Mandalorian", which is an American space western series.

The main character is a guy from the planet Mandalore and called "Mando".
